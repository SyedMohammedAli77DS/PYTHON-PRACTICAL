    "following on the Command Line (cmd.exe):\n",
    "C:\\Users\\Your Name>python --version\n",
    "To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command \n",
    "line or on Mac open the Terminal and type:\n",
    "    python --version\n",

    "Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) \n",
    "files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.\n",
    "The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:\n",
    "C:\\Users\\Your Name>python helloworld.py\n",
    "Where \"helloworld.py\" is the name of your python file.\n",
    "Lets write Where \"helloworld.py\" is the name of your python file.\n",

    "Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you \n",
    "saved your file, and run:\n",
    "C:\\Users\\Your Name>python helloworld.py\n",
    "The output should read:\n",

    "# The Python Command Line\n",
    "To test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not to write the code in a file. This is made possible because Python can be run as a command line itself.\n",
    "Type the following on the Windows, Mac or Linux command line:\n",
    "C:\\Users\\Your Name>python\n",
    "From there you can write any python, including our hello world example from earlier in the tutorial:\n",
    "    >>> print(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Which will write \"Hello, World!\" in the command line:\n",
    "Hello, World!\n",
